# PST Mail

The PST mailbox is already configured on the host. Do not ask the user for a
PST path, Outlook login, Microsoft 365 account, Microsoft Graph access, OAuth
credentials, or Aspose.

Use `curl` against the local PST service at `http://127.0.0.1:9003`. Do not use
NemoClaw/OpenShell hostnames such as `host.docker.internal` or
`host.openshell.internal` in this native OpenClaw version.

Use short request timeouts so a missing service does not stall the agent turn:

```bash
curl -fsS --max-time 10 http://127.0.0.1:9003/folders
curl -fsS --max-time 10 http://127.0.0.1:9003/emails/count
curl -fsS --max-time 10 'http://127.0.0.1:9003/emails/latest?count=5'
curl -fsS --max-time 10 'http://127.0.0.1:9003/emails/search_subject?keyword=attachment&max_results=5'
curl -fsS --max-time 10 'http://127.0.0.1:9003/emails/search_sender?sender=saqib&max_results=5'
```

When reporting results, summarize folder counts or matching emails clearly.
Include subjects, folders, senders, dates, and a short body excerpt when useful.
